# IllusionGameReliability

## Introduction 
The main aim of this study is to assess the reliability of the general factor of illusion sensitivity (Factor *i*), and its correlations with inter-individual traits, that we found in a previous study.

## Hypotheses

1. **Effect of Illusion Strength and Difficulty**
1.1 *On error rate*
1.1.1 Positive effect of illusion strength on error rate (H0: no effect)
1.1.2 Positive effect of task difficulty on error rate (H0: no effect)
1.2 *On RT*
2. **General Factor**
3. **Reliability**
4. **Stability**
5. **Dispositional Correlates**

## Methods

### Ethics information

### Pilot data

10 participants were recruited ...

### Procedure

#### Illusion Task

Similarly to the previous study, the manipulated experimental variables are the *illusion strength* (i.e., the extent to which the surrounding context of targets of each stimulus reinforces the illusion), and the *objective difference* (i.e., the degree of actual difference in physical attributes between the targets of a stimulus). 3 illusions were included - namely, Ebbinghaus, Müller-Lyer, and Vertical-Horizontal, that was previously found to most strongly contribute to the general Factor *i*.

The task starts with 6 training trials per illusion type, followed by a first series of blocks of 64 illusion trials for each illusion type, in which the trial order was randomized. After this first series of illusion blocks has been presented, a second series is presented (with different items) a second time. In total, each participant completes 384 illusion trials (2 x 64 x 3).

#### Perceptual Task

To confirm that the illusion sensitivity measured by the illusion task is not just a pure reflection of perceptual abilities, participants were presented with a similar task, but in which targets were presented without the surrounding context (i.e., without illusions), differing only in terms of their objective difference. For instance, in the case of the Ebbinghaus illusion, 2 circles of different sizes will be displayed side by side without the surrounding circles that create the illusion.

The perceptual trial blocks will be administered at the end, after a series of questionnaires (see below). Each of the 3 illusion types included 64 trials, presented in a randomized order and split into two series, similarly to the illusion task. In total, each participant completes 192 perceptual task trials (2 x 32 x 3).

#### Questionnaires

A series of questionnaires was administered in between the illusion task and the perceptual task, in a randomized order. All scales were presented as described in their validation study. However, one attention check item was included within the items of each questionnaire (e.g., "example 1", "example 2"), with the exception of the PHQ-4 (which only consists of 4 items).

##### Personality

With the goal of replicating the previous study and confirming the links between illusion sensitivity and personality, we included:

- The [**Mini IPIP6**](https://www.psychology.org.nz/journal-archive/Sibley-IPIP61.pdf) (Mini International Personality Item Pool; Sibley, 2012) measures 6 'normal' personality dimensions (Honesty-Humility, Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness) with 24 7-point Likert scale (strongly disagree - strongly agree) items.
- The [**PID-5-SF**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5142430/) (Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Short Form; Thimm et al., 2016) measures 5 maladaptive personality traits (disinhibition, antagonism, detachment, negative affect and psychoticism) with 25 4-point Likert scale items (0-Very False or Often False to 3-Very True or Often True).

##### Psychopathology

Based on the literature of illusion sensitivity and psychopathology, convergent validity was assessed by measuring schizotypal and autistic traits. Divergent validity was assessed by measuring depression and anxiety, as we do not hypothesize links with illusion sensitivity.

- The [**SPQ-BRU**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4834869/) (Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire – brief revised updated; Davidson et al., 2016) measures 4 primary schizotypy dimensions (cognitive-perceptual/positive, interpersonal/negative, disorganized and social anxiety) comprised of 9 secondary factors using 32 5-point likert scale items (Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree).
- The [**ASQ - Short**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076581/) (Autism-Spectrum Quotient; Hoekstra et al., 2011) measures 5 autistic traits (social skills, routine, switching, imagination, numbers/patterns) using 28 4-point Likert scale items (definitely disagree - definitely agree).
- The [**MSI-BPD**](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-10325-009) (Mclean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder; Zanarini et al., 2003) measures borderline personality with 10 5-point Likert scale items ([Huczewska et al., 2019]( https://doi.org/10.5114/cipp.2019.89674)).
- The [**PHQ-4**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19996233/) (Patient Health Questionnaire; Kroenke et al., 2009) assesses anxiety and depression (2 items each) with 4-point Likert scales (0 - not at all to 3 - nearly every day).

##### Interoception

Imprecise predictions of internal bodily signals has been associated with an increased reliance on external environmental cues ([Synofzik et al., 2010](10.1093/brain/awp291); [Seth et al., 2012](10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00395)), which should translate into a lesser illusion sensitivity of people with lower interoceptive skills. This is in line with with the evidence showing that autism and schizophrenia, in which decreased interoceptive abilities are reported ([Notredame et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnint.2014.00063); [Ciszewski et al., 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.12740/PP/27072); [Park et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.15739); [Bölte et al., 2007](10.1007/s10803-006-0231-x)), are also associated with a lower illusion sensitivity.

- The [**MAIA-2**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208034) (Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Version 2; Mehling et al., 2018) measures 5 facets of interoception (Noticing, Not Distancing, Not Worrying, Attention Regulation, Emotional Awareness, Self-Regulation, Body Listening and Trusting) with 37 items.
- The [**IAS-R**](https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/InteroceptiveAccuracyScale) (Interoceptive Accuracy Scale Revised; adapted from [Murphy et al., 2019](http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fqgu4)), measures 5 aspects of bodily perception (Interoception, Nociception, Expulsion, Elimination, Skin) using 18 analagog scales.

##### Beliefs and Misbeliefs

[van Prooijen et al. (2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2331) report illusory pattern perception (misperception of meaningful patterns in random stimuli) to be positively linked to greater belief in conspiracy theories, suggesting that individuals with greater conspiracy mindset may have a greater need to make sense of or impose order of the world and hence may be more aware of external cues, thus influencing their illusion sensitivity. This is in line with [van Elk (2015)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130422#sec002), that showed an association between conspiracy beliefs and a stronger local-to-global interference effect (i.e., a difficulty in ignoring irrelevant local visual information when making a decision about the global stimulus features).


- The [**GCB**](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00279) (Generic Conspiracist Beliefs scale; Brotherton, 2013) measures 5 aspects related to conspiracy beliefs (Government malfeasance, malevolent global conspiracies, Extraterrestrial cover-up, personal well-being, control of information) using 15 5-point likert scale items (defintely not true - defintely true).
- The [**PI-18**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pas0001055) (Primals Inventory; Clifton & Yaden, 2021) measures 6 primal beliefs (Safe, Enticing, Alive, Changing, Understandable, Hierarchical) using 32 6-point likert scale  items (strongly disagree - strongly agree). The items from the 3 first dimensions can also be pooled to measure the highest-order primal belief (Good).
- The [**LIE scale**](https://psyarxiv.com/t7s32/) (Lying Profile Questionnaire; Makowski et al., 2020) measures 4 dispositional lying dimensions (Ability, Negativity, Contextuality and Frequency) with 16 items on a visual analog scale (Disagree - Agree)


#### Session 2

Participants were invited to complete the illusion task again, about 1 week following their initial participation.
