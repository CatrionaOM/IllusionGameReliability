# IllusionGameReliability

## Procedure 

### Illusion Task


6 training trials + (64 + 64) items

### Perceptual Task

(16 + 16) items

### Questionnaires

#### Personality

With the goal of replicating the previous study and confirming the links between illusion sensitivity and personality: 

- **Mini IPIP6**: measures 'normal' personality  across 6 dimensions (Honesty-Humility, Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Openness, Conscientiousness) using 24 items via a 7 point likert scale (strongly disagree - strongly agree)
- **PID-5**: measures maladaptive personality traits using 25 items across 5 dimensions (disinhibition, antagonism, detachment, negative affect and psychoticism)

#### Psychopathology

Convergent validity based on the literature on illusion sensitivity and psychopathology. Also, divergent validity as we do not hypothesize links with depression or anxiety.

- [Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire - Brief (SPQ-B)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1521/pedi.1995.9.4.346): 22 items assessing 3 dimensions of schizotypy (cognitive-perceptual/positive, interpersonal/negative, disorganized) using a dichotomous scale (yes-no)
- [Autism Spectrum Quotient - Short (ASQ - Short)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076581/): 28 item measure of autistic traits with 5 dimensions (social skills, routine, switching, imagination, numbers/patterns; measured on 4-point Likert scale (definitely disagree - definitely agree)
- BPD 
- Depression anxiety

## Interoception

Exploratory: conceptual literature suggesting a link between interoception and predictive coding (?)

- **MAIA-2**: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208034
- **ISQ-20**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3600-3

## Beliefs

Exploratory.

- [Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00279) - 15 items assessing 5 dimensions (Government malfeasance, malevolent global conspiracies, Extraterrestrial cover-up, personal well-being, control of information) using a 5-point likert scale (defintely not true - defintely true)
- [PI-18 (Primals Inventory - 18 items)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pas0001055): measures 3 secondary primals (*Safe*, *Enticing*, *Alive*) on a 6-point likert scale (strongly disagree - strongly agree); items can also be pooled to measure the highest-order primal (*Good*)
