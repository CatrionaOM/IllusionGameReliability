## Introduction

Visual illusions are beguiling stimuli that reveal how the brain integrates prior beliefs with incoming sensory evidence to inform our perception of reality ([Carbon, 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00566)). While early research theorized a common mechanism underlying people's sensitivity to illusions ([Halpern et al., 1999](https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article/11/5/521/3374/Interindividual-Variation-in-Human-Visual); [Thurstone, 1944](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1945-00890-000)), recent empirical studies reported at best weak correlations between inter-individual resistance to distinct illusions ([Grzeczkowski et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004269891630150X); [Grzeczkowski et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178117305978)). This issue is important given the theorethical proposition that the effect of illusions is not only an artifact caused by our perceptual system, but a marker of a general feature of our cognitive systems...

The idea that visual illusions do indeed reflect charasteritics of functioning at a general cognitive level is supported by evidence linking them to high-level perturbations of the cognitive system, such as ...

Similarly, despite the theoretical arguments made in favour of the existence of a link between illusion sensitivity and participants' characteristics (personality ([Zhang et al., 2017](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/tnsci-2017-0004/html?lang=en); [Konrath et al., 2009](10.1111/j.1467-6494.2009.00579.x); [Blake &Palmisano, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1177/0301006621100019)) and psychopathological traits or disorders ([Baroun & Al-Ansari, 2005](10.2224/sbp.2005.33.1.33); [D’Amour et al., 2021](10.3758/s13414-020-02228-3)), the empirical evidence remains weak ([Kaliuzhna ert al., 2019](10.1016/j.schres.2018.12.027); [Yang et al., 2012](10.1177/2167702612464618); [Manning et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1186%2Fs13229-017-0127-y)).

In an attempt to address some of the limitations of previous studies, [Makowski et al. (*under review*)](https://psyarxiv.com/9pjx5/) introduced a new paradigm that allows manipulating various illusory effects in a continuous manner, and measuring the objective behavioural effect (on error rates and response time) of various traditional illusions. Using this *"Illusion Game"* framework, they reported evidence for the existence of a general factor (labelled Factor *i*) to the inter-individual sensitivity to 10 different illusions, as well as relationships with personality traits. However, several limitations were noted, including the potential confounding effect of purely perceptual abilities (unrelated to illusion sensitivity *per se*), and the non-inclusion of response times - which could potentially capture different mechanisms related to illusion processing - in the factor analysis.

Using a short version of the Illusion Game (made of 3 illusion types), the aim of the present study is to 1) replicate previous findings regarding the common factor of illusion sensitivity and its links with personality, 2) extend these findings to more targeted participant characteristics (such as schizotypal and autistic traits), 3) test the validity and reliability of the measure using a control task of perceptual discrimination and test-retest protocol.

## Hypotheses

We grouped our hypotheses according to 3 levels of expectation strength (*replication* of the Illusion Game original study, *confirmation* of the findings reported by past studies, and *exploration* of potential hypotheses based on theoretical models and assumptions). The null hypothesis (H0) corresponds to no significant effect.

### Replication

#### Psychometry

1. **Effect of Illusion Strength and Difficulty**
    - 1.1 *On error rate*
        - 1.1.1 Positive effect of illusion strength on error rate
        - 1.1.2 Positive effect of task difficulty on error rate
    - 1.2 *On RT*
        - 1.2.1 Negative effect of illusion strength on response time
        - 1.2.2 Negative effect of task difficulty on response time
2. **General Factor *i***
    - 2.1 Across different illusions, inter-individual illusion scores load onto a unique latent dimension that reflects a general sensitivity to illusions

#### Inter-individual Correlates

3. **Normal personality traits**
    - 3.1 Positive correlation between illusion sensitivity and Agreableness
    - 3.2 Positive correlation between illusion sensitivity and Honesty-Humility
4. **Maladaptive personality traits**
    - 4.1 Negative correlation between illusion sensitivity and Antagonism
    - 4.2 Negative correlation between illusion sensitivity and Disinhibition
    - 4.3 Negative correlation between illusion sensitivity and Negative Affect
    - 4.4 Negative correlation between illusion sensitivity and Psychoticism

### Confirmation

5. **Autism and Schizotypal traits**

Under the predictive coding framework, illusion sensitivity has been theorized to be related to an underweighting of prior knowledge when making perceptual inferences ([Notredame et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4130106/); [Koethe et al., 2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-008-0851-6)). Indeed, this is consistent with findings in which susceptibility to different visual illusions was lower in individuals with a lower competence in contextual integrations, such as those with higher disorganized and positive schizotypal traits ([Bressan & Kramer, 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00343); [Fradkin & Silverstein, 2022](10.1016/j.bionps.2022.100050)), as well as those with high systemizing tendencies (often associated with autism; [Walter et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-008-0630-2)).

- 5.1 Negative correlation between illusion sensitivity and autistic traits, specifically in dimensions related to systemizing tendencies (measured with the *Patterns/Numbers* subscale)
- 5.2 Negative correlation between illusion sensitivity and schizotypal personality traits, particularly in the positive (measured with the *Cognitive-Perceptual* subscale) and disorganized dimensions (measured with the *Disorganized* subscale)

6. **Mood and Emotion Regulation**

While the literature regarding the links between emotion and mood dysregulation with illusion sensitivity is sparse, some researchers report higher trait anxiety to be related to reduced illusion sensitivity ([Baroun & Al-Ansari, 2005](10.2224/sbp.2005.33.1.33); [Passie et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2012.722649)). In fact, consistent with the predictive coding theory, anxiety has been linked to having hyper-precise prior beliefs and a decreased ability to consider contextual information, thereby resulting in individuals creating incoherent percepts that are resistant to belief updating ([Passie et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2012.722649); [Hein et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117424)). Alternatively, we expect borderline personality traits to correlate negatively with illusion sensitivity due to its association with interoceptive deficits ([Flasbeck et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40479-020-00139-1)). On the other hand, research on visual illusion sensitivity related to depressive traits have typically not found any significant effects ([Koethe et al., 2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-008-0851-6); [Passie et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2012.722649)).

- 6.1 Negative correlation between illusion sensitivity and depression scores
- 6.2 No correlation between illusion sensitivity and anxiety scores
- 6.2 Positive correlation between illusion sensitivity and borderline personality traits

### Exploration

#### Psychometry

7. **Test-retest Reliability**
    - 7.1 Inter-individual illusion scores at time point 1 (*t2*) will correlate significantly with the scores at time point 2 (*t2*)
8. **Within-participants Stability**
    - 8.1 The inter-individual scores are estimated with a lower uncertainty (95% CI width) than the range (95% ETI) of the point-estimates (i.e., larger between-participants variance than within-participants).
9. **Perceptual independence**
    - 9.1 None to weak correlation between illusion sensitivity and perceptual ability.

#### Inter-individual Correlates

10. **Conspiracy Beliefs**

Although little attention has been conferred to investigating the links between conspiracy beliefs and illusion sensitivity, [van Prooijen et al. (2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2331) report illusory pattern perception (misperception of meaningful patterns in random stimuli) to be positively linked to greater belief in conspiracy theories, suggesting that individuals with a greater conspiracy mindset may have a greater need to make sense of or impose order of the world and hence may be more aware of external cues, thus influencing their illusion sensitivity. This is in line with [van Elk (2015)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130422#sec002), that showed an association between conspiracy beliefs and a stronger local-to-global interference effect (i.e., a difficulty in ignoring irrelevant local visual information when making a decision about the global stimulus features).

- 10.1 Negative correlation between illusion sensitivity and conspiracy beliefs
    
11. **Interoception**

Imprecise predictions of internal bodily signals has been associated with an increased reliance on external environmental cues ([Synofzik et al., 2010](10.1093/brain/awp291); [Seth et al., 2012](10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00395)), which should translate into a lesser illusion sensitivity of people with lower interoceptive skills. This is in line with with the evidence showing that autism and schizophrenia, in which decreased interoceptive abilities are reported ([Notredame et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnint.2014.00063); [Ciszewski et al., 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.12740/PP/27072); [Park et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.15739); [Bölte et al., 2007](10.1007/s10803-006-0231-x)), are also associated with a lower illusion sensitivity.

- 11.1 Positive correlation between illusion sensitivity and interoception

12. **Lying tendency**

Given the negative link observed between illusion sensitivity and honesty-humility, as well as with maladaptive personality traits [(Makowski et al.,*under review*)](https://psyarxiv.com/9pjx5/), we expect other related dimensions to relate, such as dispositional lying tendencies ([Makowski et al., 2020](https://psyarxiv.com/t7s32/)).

- 11.1 Negative correlation between illusion sensitivity and deception profile

13. **Primal beliefs**

Our basic beliefs about the world (i.e., primals) influence the way we interact with it. As such, having greater beliefs that the world is *Safe*, comprehensible (*Understandable*), does not stay static (*Changing*) and that there is an inherent underlying order (*Hierarchical*), may influence people's vigilance towards environmental cues ([Clifton et al., 2021](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pas0001055)), and thus be associated with illusion sensitivity. This is in line with the negative link found between conspiracy beliefs (which is negatively correlated with beliefs in a safe world; [Leone et al., 2017](10.1002/ijop.12459)) and illusory pattern perception ([van Prooijen et al. (2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2331)).

- 13.1 Negative correlation between illusion sensitivity and the "Safe" primal belief
- 13.2 Negative correlation between illusion sensitivity and the "Changing" primal belief
- 13.3 Positive correlation between illusion sensitivity and the "Understandable" primal belief
- 13.4 Positive correlation between illusion sensitivity and the "Hierarchical" primal belief


## Methods

### Ethics information

This study was approved by the NTU Institutional Review Board (NTU IRB-2022-187) and all procedures performed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional board and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration. All participants provided their informed consent prior to participation and were incentivized after completing the study.

### Pilot data

10 participants were recruited via the crowd-sourcing platform *Prolific*. The only inclusion criterion specified was a fluent proficiency in English to ensure that the task instructions would be well-understood. Participants were incentivised with a reward of about \textsterling 7.50 for completing the task, which took about one hour to finish (session 1 + session 2).


### Procedure

Participants were randomly assigned to 2 different conditions, of which they were either presented with the Illusion Task followed by Perceptual Task, or vice versa. In both conditions, a series of self-report questionnaires were administered in between the 2 main experimental tasks.

#### Illusion Task

Three illusions that were previously found to most strongly contribute to the general Factor *i* were included in this version of the task - namely, Ebbinghaus, Müller-Lyer, and Vertical-Horizontal. The manipulated experimental variables are the *illusion strength* (i.e., the extent to which the surrounding context of targets of each stimulus reinforces the illusion), and the *objective difference* (i.e., the degree of actual difference in physical attributes between the targets of a stimulus).

The task started with 6 training trials per illusion type, followed by a first series of blocks of 64 illusion trials for each illusion type, in which the trial order was randomized. After this first series of illusion blocks has been presented, a different series is presented (with distinct items) a second time. In total, each participant completes 384 illusion trials (2 x 64 x 3), of which the goal was to answer "as fast as possible and without making errors" (an explicit double constraint on the speed-accuracy trade-off). Trials of the same block were separated by a fixation cross (presented for a random duration between 500 - 1000s), that was spatially jittered around the center of the screen (in a radius of a 1 cm), attenuating its usefulness as a potential reference point.

#### Perceptual Task

To confirm that the illusion sensitivity measured by the illusion task is not simply a pure reflection of perceptual abilities, participants were administered a perception task that was largely similar to the Illusion Task, but in which targets were presented without the surrounding context (i.e., without illusions), differing only in terms of their objective difference. For instance, in the case of the Ebbinghaus illusion, 2 circles of different sizes were displayed side by side without the surrounding circles that create the illusion. Each of the 3 illusion types included 64 trials, presented in a randomized order and split into two series, similar to the Illusion Task. In total, each participant completed 192 Perceptual Task trials (2 x 32 x 3).

#### Questionnaires

A series of questionnaires were administered in between the Illusion Task and the Perceptual Task, in a randomized order. To prevent fatigue, these questionnaires were split and administered in 2 separate sessions one week apart. In session 1, the **Mini-IPIP6**, **PID-5**, **SPQ_BRU**, **ASQ - Short**, **IAS_R**, **PHQ-4**, **GCB** and **LIE scale** were presented, whereas in session 2, the **MAIA-2**, **MSI-BPD** and **PI-18** were administered. All scales were presented as described in their validation study. However, one attention check item was included within the items of each questionnaire (e.g., "example 1", "example 2"), with the exception of the PHQ-4 (which only consists of 4 items). Visual analog scales, instead of Likert scales with only 2 extreme anchors, were adapted for the MAIA, MSI-BPD, Mini-IPIP6 and IAS-R questionnaires to limit centrality bias.

##### Personality

- The [**Mini IPIP6**](https://www.psychology.org.nz/journal-archive/Sibley-IPIP61.pdf) (Mini International Personality Item Pool; Sibley, 2012) measures 6 'normal' personality dimensions (Honesty-Humility, Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness) with 24 7-point Likert scale (strongly disagree - strongly agree) items.
- The [**PID-5-SF**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5142430/) (Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Short Form; Thimm et al., 2016) measures 5 maladaptive personality traits (disinhibition, antagonism, detachment, negative affect and psychoticism) with 25 4-point Likert scale items (0-Very False or Often False to 3-Very True or Often True).

##### Psychopathology

- The [**SPQ-BRU**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4834869/) (Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire – brief revised updated; Davidson et al., 2016) measures 4 primary schizotypy dimensions (cognitive-perceptual/positive, interpersonal/negative, disorganized and social anxiety) comprised of 9 secondary factors using 32 5-point Likert scale items (Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree).
- The [**ASQ - Short**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076581/) (Autism-Spectrum Quotient; Hoekstra et al., 2011) measures 5 autistic traits (social skills, routine, switching, imagination, numbers/patterns) using 28 4-point Likert scale items (definitely disagree - definitely agree).
- The [**MSI-BPD**](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-10325-009) (Mclean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder; Zanarini et al., 2003) measures borderline personality with 10 5-point Likert scale items ([Huczewska et al., 2019]( https://doi.org/10.5114/cipp.2019.89674)).
- The [**PHQ-4**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19996233/) (Patient Health Questionnaire; Kroenke et al., 2009) assesses anxiety and depression (2 items each) with 4-point Likert scales (0 - not at all to 3 - nearly every day).

##### Interoception

- The [**MAIA-2**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208034) (Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Version 2; Mehling et al., 2018) measures 5 facets of interoception (Noticing, Not Distancing, Not Worrying, Attention Regulation, Emotional Awareness, Self-Regulation, Body Listening and Trusting) with 37 items.
- The [**IAS-R**](https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/InteroceptiveAccuracyScale) (Interoceptive Accuracy Scale Revised; adapted from [Murphy et al., 2019](http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fqgu4)), measures 5 aspects of bodily perception (Interoception, Nociception, Expulsion, Elimination, Skin) using 18 analagog scales.

##### Beliefs and Misbeliefs

- The [**GCB**](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00279) (Generic Conspiracist Beliefs scale; Brotherton, 2013) measures 5 aspects related to conspiracy beliefs (Government malfeasance, malevolent global conspiracies, Extraterrestrial cover-up, personal well-being, control of information) using 15 5-point likert scale items (defintely not true - defintely true).
- The [**PI-18**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pas0001055) (Primals Inventory; Clifton & Yaden, 2021) measures 6 primal beliefs (Safe, Enticing, Alive, Changing, Understandable, Hierarchical) using 32 6-point likert scale  items (strongly disagree - strongly agree). The items from the 3 first dimensions can also be pooled to measure the highest-order primal belief (Good).
- The [**LIE scale**](https://psyarxiv.com/t7s32/) (Lying Profile Questionnaire; Makowski et al., 2020) measures 4 dispositional lying dimensions (Ability, Negativity, Contextuality and Frequency) with 16 items on a visual analog scale (Disagree - Agree)


#### Session 2

Participants were invited to complete (only) the Illusion Task again, about 2 weeks following their initial participation. To avoid session 1 from being too long, the MAIA-2, MSI-BPD and PI-18 questionnaires were administered during session 2, after the Illusion Task.

### Design Plan

This study will have a within-subjects design with repeated measures. Data collection and analysis will not be performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. Prior to the start of the experiment, all participants will be required to give their consent via an informed consent form, where the study's purpose will be stated. However, participants will not be explicitly informed of the independent variables measured and the research hypotheses.

The materials and procedure of the experiment will be the same as the pilot study (see above).


### Sampling plan

Although the Bayesian analysis approach moves the focus away from null-hypothesis testing and towards evidence quantification (for instance, by means of Bayes factors), a frequentist power-analysis was run nonetheless (https://sample-size.net/correlation-sample-size/). Using α = .05, β = .2 and the average correlation reported by [Makowski et al. (*under review*)] of r = .17, the suggested minimum target sample size was 240 participants. To account for potential outliers, drop-outs and attrition rate (participants that did not participate in session 2), we aim at recruiting 400 participants.

### Analysis Plan

The analysis script is available in ...

Data of participants with outlying scores (in regard to the population distributions) will be further examined and potentially excluded if there is reason to suspect that they did not pay attention to the task (e.g., failing to make the appropriate response to attention check items embedded in questionnaires, the presence of a high number of errors in “easy” trials, as well as a very short total duration, might suggest that participants answered randomly to quickly finish the task). In this study, missing data will be prevented through the implementation of a forced-choice reaction-time behavioural task, in which the trial does not proceed to the next display until participants make a response.
