# The Illusion Game 2: Reliability and Validity

## Introduction

Visual illusions are beguiling stimuli that reveal how the brain integrates prior beliefs with incoming sensory evidence to inform our perception of reality ([Carbon, 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00566)). While early research theorized a common mechanism underlying people's sensitivity to illusions ([Halpern et al., 1999](https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article/11/5/521/3374/Interindividual-Variation-in-Human-Visual); [Thurstone, 1944](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1945-00890-000)), recent empirical studies reported at best weak correlations between inter-individual resistance to distinct illusions ([Grzeczkowski et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004269891630150X); [Grzeczkowski et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178117305978)). Similarly, the theorethical arguments made in favour of the existence of a link between illusion sensitivity and participants' characteristics (personality and psychopathological traits or disorders), the empirical evidence remains weak **[REFS]**.

In an attempt to address some of the limitations of previous studies, [Makowski et al. (*under review*)](https://psyarxiv.com/9pjx5/) introduced a new paradigm that allows to manipulate the effect of various illusions in a continuous manner, and to collect the objective behavioural effect (on error rates and response time) of various traditional illusions. Using this *"Illusion Game"* framework, they reported evidence for the existence of a general factor (labelled Factor *i*) to the inter-individual sensitivity to 10 different illusions, as well as relationships with personality traits. However, several limitations were noted, including the potential confounding effect of purely perceptual abilities (unrelated to illusion sensitivity *per se*), and the non-inclusion of response times in the factor analysis (which could potentially capture different mechanisms related to illusion processing). 

Using a short version of the Illusion Game (made of 3 distinct illusion types), the aim of the present study is to 1) replicate previous findings regarding the common factor of illusion sensitivity and the links with personality, 2) extend these findings to more targeted participant characteristics (such as shcizotypic and autistic traits), 3) test the validity and reliability of the measure using a control task of perceptual discrimination and test-retest protocol.

## Hypotheses

We grouped our hypotheses according to 3 levels of expectation strength (*replication* of the Illugion Game original study, *confirmation* of the findings reported by past studies, and *exploration* of potential hypotheses based on theorethical models and assumptions). The null hypothesis (H0) is no significant effect.

## Methods

### Ethics information

This study was approved by the ... **TODO**

### Pilot data

10 participants were recruited via the crowd-sourcing platform *Prolific*. The only inclusion criterion specified was a fluent proficiency in English to ensure that the task instructions would be well-understood. Participants were incentivised with a reward of about \textsterling 7.50 for completing the task, which took about one hour to finish (session 1 + session 2).


### Procedure

#### Illusion Task

Similarly to the previous study, the manipulated experimental variables are the *illusion strength* (i.e., the extent to which the surrounding context of targets of each stimulus reinforces the illusion), and the *objective difference* (i.e., the degree of actual difference in physical attributes between the targets of a stimulus). 3 illusions were included - namely, Ebbinghaus, MÃ¼ller-Lyer, and Vertical-Horizontal, that was previously found to most strongly contribute to the general Factor *i*.

The task starts with 6 training trials per illusion type, followed by a first series of blocks of 64 illusion trials for each illusion type, in which the trial order was randomized. After this first series of illusion blocks has been presented, a different series is presented (with distinct items) a second time. In total, each participant completes 384 illusion trials (2 x 64 x 3), of which the goal was to answer "as fast as possible and without making errors" (an explicit double constraint on the speed-accuracy trade-off). Trials of the same block were separated by a fixation cross (presented for a random duration between 500 - 1000s), that was spatially jittered around the center of the screen (in a radius of a 1 cm), attenuating its usefulness as a potential reference point.   

#### Perceptual Task

To confirm that the illusion sensitivity measured by the illusion task is not just a pure reflection of perceptual abilities, participants are presented with a perception task that is largely similar to the illusion task, but in which targets are presented without the surrounding context (i.e., without illusions), differing only in terms of their objective difference. For instance, in the case of the Ebbinghaus illusion, 2 circles of different sizes will be displayed side by side without the surrounding circles that create the illusion.

The perceptual trial blocks will be administered towards the end of the experiment, after a series of self-report questionnaires (see below). Each of the 3 illusion types included 64 trials, presented in a randomized order and split into two series, similarly to the illusion task. In total, each participant completes 192 perceptual task trials (2 x 32 x 3).

#### Questionnaires

A series of questionnaires are administered in between the illusion task and the perceptual task, in a randomized order. To prevent fatigue, these questionnaires were split and administered in 2 separate sessions one week apart. In session 1, the Mini-IPIP6, PID-5, SPQ_BRU, ASQ - Short, IAS_R, PHQ-4, GCB and LIE scale were presented, whereas in session 2, the MAIA-2, MSI-BPD and PI-18 were administered. All scales are presented as described in their validation study. However, one attention check item was included within the items of each questionnaire (e.g., "example 1", "example 2"), with the exception of the PHQ-4 (which only consists of 4 items). Visual analog scales, instead of Likert scales with only 2 extreme anchors, were adapted for the MAIA, MSI-BPD, Mini-IPIP6 and IAS-R questionnaires to limit centrality bias.

##### Personality

With the goal of replicating the previous study and confirming the links between illusion sensitivity and personality, we included:

- The [**Mini IPIP6**](https://www.psychology.org.nz/journal-archive/Sibley-IPIP61.pdf) (Mini International Personality Item Pool; Sibley, 2012) measures 6 'normal' personality dimensions (Honesty-Humility, Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness) with 24 7-point Likert scale (strongly disagree - strongly agree) items.
- The [**PID-5-SF**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5142430/) (Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Short Form; Thimm et al., 2016) measures 5 maladaptive personality traits (disinhibition, antagonism, detachment, negative affect and psychoticism) with 25 4-point Likert scale items (0-Very False or Often False to 3-Very True or Often True).

##### Psychopathology

Based on the literature of illusion sensitivity and psychopathology, convergent validity was assessed by measuring schizotypal ([Notredame et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4130106/); [Grzeczkowski et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178117305978); [Lanyi et al., 2022](10.31234/osf.io/cbsm3)), anxious ([Passie et al., 2013](10.1080/13548506.2012.722649); [Ioakeimidis et al., 2021](10.1017/pen.2020.16)) and autistic traits ([Gori et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842763/); [Razeghi et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/03004430.2020.1802260);[Park et al., 2022](10.1111/ejn.15739)). Divergent validity was assessed by measuring depression, as we do not hypothesize links with illusion sensitivity ([Koethe et al., 2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-008-0851-6); [Passie et al., 2013](10.1080/13548506.2012.722649)).

- The [**SPQ-BRU**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4834869/) (Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire â brief revised updated; Davidson et al., 2016) measures 4 primary schizotypy dimensions (cognitive-perceptual/positive, interpersonal/negative, disorganized and social anxiety) comprised of 9 secondary factors using 32 5-point likert scale items (Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree).
- The [**ASQ - Short**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076581/) (Autism-Spectrum Quotient; Hoekstra et al., 2011) measures 5 autistic traits (social skills, routine, switching, imagination, numbers/patterns) using 28 4-point Likert scale items (definitely disagree - definitely agree).
- The [**MSI-BPD**](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-10325-009) (Mclean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder; Zanarini et al., 2003) measures borderline personality with 10 5-point Likert scale items ([Huczewska et al., 2019]( https://doi.org/10.5114/cipp.2019.89674)).
- The [**PHQ-4**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19996233/) (Patient Health Questionnaire; Kroenke et al., 2009) assesses anxiety and depression (2 items each) with 4-point Likert scales (0 - not at all to 3 - nearly every day).

##### Interoception

Imprecise predictions of internal bodily signals has been associated with an increased reliance on external environmental cues ([Synofzik et al., 2010](10.1093/brain/awp291); [Seth et al., 2012](10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00395)), which should translate into a lesser illusion sensitivity of people with lower interoceptive skills. This is in line with with the evidence showing that autism and schizophrenia, in which decreased interoceptive abilities are reported ([Notredame et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnint.2014.00063); [Ciszewski et al., 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.12740/PP/27072); [Park et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.15739); [BÃ¶lte et al., 2007](10.1007/s10803-006-0231-x)), are also associated with a lower illusion sensitivity.

- The [**MAIA-2**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208034) (Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Version 2; Mehling et al., 2018) measures 5 facets of interoception (Noticing, Not Distancing, Not Worrying, Attention Regulation, Emotional Awareness, Self-Regulation, Body Listening and Trusting) with 37 items.
- The [**IAS-R**](https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/InteroceptiveAccuracyScale) (Interoceptive Accuracy Scale Revised; adapted from [Murphy et al., 2019](http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fqgu4)), measures 5 aspects of bodily perception (Interoception, Nociception, Expulsion, Elimination, Skin) using 18 analagog scales.

##### Beliefs and Misbeliefs

[van Prooijen et al. (2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2331) report illusory pattern perception (misperception of meaningful patterns in random stimuli) to be positively linked to greater belief in conspiracy theories, suggesting that individuals with greater conspiracy mindset may have a greater need to make sense of or impose order of the world and hence may be more aware of external cues, thus influencing their illusion sensitivity. This is in line with [van Elk (2015)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130422#sec002), that showed an association between conspiracy beliefs and a stronger local-to-global interference effect (i.e., a difficulty in ignoring irrelevant local visual information when making a decision about the global stimulus features). To this end, basic beliefs regarding the world (i.e., primals), such that there exists an inherent underlying order; that the world is comprehensible; that everything changes, may also be associated with people's vigilance towards social cues, hence affecting their sensitivity towards visual illusions ([Clifton et al., 2021](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pas0001055)). Additionally, given the significant links found between maladaptive personality traits and illusion sensitivity in a previous study, we expect dispositional lying behaviour, which comprises dimensions related to pathological traits ([Makowski et al., 2020](https://psyarxiv.com/t7s32/)), to be correlated with inter-individual illusion sensitivity.   


- The [**GCB**](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00279) (Generic Conspiracist Beliefs scale; Brotherton, 2013) measures 5 aspects related to conspiracy beliefs (Government malfeasance, malevolent global conspiracies, Extraterrestrial cover-up, personal well-being, control of information) using 15 5-point likert scale items (defintely not true - defintely true).
- The [**PI-18**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pas0001055) (Primals Inventory; Clifton & Yaden, 2021) measures 6 primal beliefs (Safe, Enticing, Alive, Changing, Understandable, Hierarchical) using 32 6-point likert scale  items (strongly disagree - strongly agree). The items from the 3 first dimensions can also be pooled to measure the highest-order primal belief (Good).
- The [**LIE scale**](https://psyarxiv.com/t7s32/) (Lying Profile Questionnaire; Makowski et al., 2020) measures 4 dispositional lying dimensions (Ability, Negativity, Contextuality and Frequency) with 16 items on a visual analog scale (Disagree - Agree)


#### Session 2

Participants were invited to complete the illusion task again, about 2 weeks following their initial participation. To avoid session 1 from being too long, the MAIA-2, MSI-BPD and PI-18 questionnaires were administered during session 2, after the illusion task.

### Sampling plan

Although the Bayesian analysis approach moves the focus away from null-hypothesis testing and towards evidence quantification (for instance, by means of Bayes factors), a frequentist power-analysis was run nonetheless (https://sample-size.net/correlation-sample-size/). Based on the average correlation reported by [Makowski et al. (*under review*)], with Î± = .05, Î² = .2, r = .17, it suggested a minimum target sample of 240 participants. To account for the outliers, drop-outs and attrition rate (participants that did not participate in session 2), we aim at recruiting 400 participants. 

### Analysis Plan

The analysis script is available in ...

Data of participants with outlying scores (in regard to the population distributions) will be further examined and potentially excluded if there is reason to suspect that they did not pay attention to the task (e.g., failing to make the appropriate response to attention check items embedded in questionnaires, the presence of a high number of errors in âeasyâ trials, as well as a very short total duration, might suggest that participants answered randomly to quickly finish the task). In this study, missing data is prevented through the implementation of a forced-choice reaction-time behavioural task, in which the trial does not proceed to the next display until participants make a response.
