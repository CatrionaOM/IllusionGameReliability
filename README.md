# Relationship between Illusion Sensitivity and Inter-individual Characteristics: A Registered Report

*Dominique Makowski, An Shu Te, Stephanie Kirk, Ngoi Zi Liang, & S.H. Annabel Chen*

<!-- ## Abstract

Despite it being a popular stimuli used in psychological research, the mechanisms underlying people's susceptibility towards visual illusions are still not well-understood. In a previous study ([Makowski et al., under review](https://psyarxiv.com/9pjx5/)), our results provided evidence in favour of a general factor (labelled Factor *i*) underlying the sensitivity to different illusions. In this study, we aim to replicate and validate our previous findings regarding the existence of the Factor *i* as well as extend its links to more targeted personality traits and characteristics (such as schizotypal and autistic traits). -->
