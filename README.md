# IllusionGameReliability

The main aim of this study is to assess the reliability of the general factor of illusion sensitivity (Factor *i*), and its correlations with inter-individual traits, that we found in a previous study.

## Procedure

### Illusion Task

Similarly to the previous study, the manipulated experimental variables are the *illusion strength* (i.e., the extent to which the surrounding context of targets of each stimulus reinforces the illusion), and the *objective difference* (i.e., the degree of actual difference in physical attributes between the targets of a stimulus). 3 illusions were included - namely, Ebbinghaus, MÃ¼ller-Lyer, and Vertical-Horizontal, that was previously found to most strongly correlate with the extracted Factor *i*.

The task starts with 6 training trials per illusion type, followed by a first series of blocks of 64 illusion trials for each illusion type, in which the trial order was randomized. After this first series of illusion blocks has been presented, a second series is presented (with different items) a second time. In total, each participant completes 384 illusion trials (2 x 64 x 3).

### Perceptual Task

To confirm that the illusion sensitivity measured by the illusion task is not just a pure reflection of perceptual abilities, participants were presented with a similar task, but in which targets were presented without the surrounding context (i.e., without illusions), differing only in terms of their objective difference. For instance, in the case of the Ebbinghaus illusion, 2 circles of different sizes will be displayed side by side without the surrounding circles that create the illusion.

The perceptual trial blocks will be administered at the end, after a series of questionnaires (see below). Each of the 3 illusion types included 64 trials, presented in a randomized order and split into two series, similarly to the illusion task. In total, each participant completes 192 perceptual task trials (2 x 32 x 3).

### Questionnaires

#### Personality

With the goal of replicating the previous study and confirming the links between illusion sensitivity and personality, the following questionnaires are given to the participants during the break between illusion and perceptual task trials:

- [Mini IPIP6](https://www.psychology.org.nz/journal-archive/Sibley-IPIP61.pdf): measures 'normal' personality  across 6 dimensions (Honesty-Humility, Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Openness, Conscientiousness) using 24 items via a 7 point likert scale (strongly disagree - strongly agree)
- [PID5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5142430/): measures maladaptive personality traits using 25 items across 5 dimensions (disinhibition, antagonism, detachment, negative affect and psychoticism)

#### Psychopathology

In order to ascertain convergent validity of Factor *i*, we administer the schizotypal, autism and borderline personality scales based on the literature of illusion sensitivity and psychopathology. Divergent validity is also assessed using the PHQ-4 as we do not hypothesize links with depression or anxiety.The specific details of the scales measuring personality and psychopathological traits are as follows:

- [Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire - Brief (SPQ-B)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1521/pedi.1995.9.4.346): 22 items assessing 3 dimensions of schizotypy (cognitive-perceptual/positive, interpersonal/negative, disorganized) using a dichotomous scale (yes-no)
- [Autism Spectrum Quotient - Short (ASQ - Short)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076581/): 28 item measure of autistic traits with 5 dimensions (social skills, routine, switching, imagination, numbers/patterns; measured on 4-point Likert scale (definitely disagree - definitely agree)
- [BPD (MSI-BPD)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-10325-009): 10 item measure of BPD using a dichotomous yes/no scale (note that the scale has also been adapted for non-diagnosis use with a likert scale; cf [Huczewska et al., 2019]( https://doi.org/10.5114/cipp.2019.89674))
- [Depression anxiety (PHQ- 4)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19996233/): 4 items assessing anxiety (2 items) and depression (2 items) on a 4-point likert scale

#### Interoception

In the context of interoception, predictive coding implies that subjective feeling states are determined by predictions about the interoceptive state of the body. Given that imprecise predictions of internal bodily signals have been shown to prompt people to rely more strongly on external cues in the environment, this suggests that individuals with poor interoceptive abilities may be less sensitive to illusions. This is in line with studies that have found schizophrenic patients, of which poor interoception is a key feature of the disorder phenomenology, to be less susceptible to the effects of visual illusions.

Consistent with [Murphy et al (2019)'s](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-019-01632-7) framework of interoception, we conceptualize interoception as being composed of 3 distinct independent dimensions: interoceptive accuracy, interoceptive sensibility and interoceptive awareness. The following scales are given to assess inter-individual trait differences in the aforementioned dimensions of interoception:

- [MAIA-2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208034): 37 item measure assessing 5 dimensions of interoception (Noticing, Not Distancing, Not Worrying, Attention Regulation, Emotional Awareness, Self-Regulation, Body Listening and Trusting)
- [ISQ-20](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3600-3): 20 item measure of interoception mostly used to assess individuals with ASD (TBC)
- [Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327752jpa5304_16): 18 item measure assessing how aware of and connected one is to how their body communicates.
- [Interoceptive Accuracy Scale (IAS)](http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fqgu4): 21 item measure assessing trait differences in self-perceived interoceptive accuracy.

#### Beliefs

Exploratory.

- [Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00279) - 15 items assessing 5 dimensions (Government malfeasance, malevolent global conspiracies, Extraterrestrial cover-up, personal well-being, control of information) using a 5-point likert scale (defintely not true - defintely true)
- [PI-18 (Primals Inventory - 18 items) + *Changing* (5 items), *Understandable* (4 items) and *Hierarchical* (5 items) subscales](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pas0001055): measures 3 secondary primals (*Safe*, *Enticing*, *Alive*) on a 6-point likert scale (strongly disagree - strongly agree); items can also be pooled to measure the highest-order primal (*Good*)
